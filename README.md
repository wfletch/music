# music
### A repository of all the things I program to assist me with music.

## Ideas
1. Metronome
   1. A queue based metronome to support 4/4 (Fo(u)r now) at varying speed.
   2. The idea is to have control messages to flush the queue as appropriate
   3. Probably not the best use of queues, but... let's see what we got!
2. Chord Spelling
   1. The idea is to create a call an response of chords, their sounds, and their spellings
   2. Inversions will also be supported
3. Inversion Spelling
   1. Given random spellings, guess the chord and the inversion/voicing.
4. Guitar Fingering
   1. This is actually a bit harder to implment than to thought.
5. Random Practice Mode
   1. TBA
6. Documenting what I am spending my time on

## TODO: Actions

I don't actually know what actions do, so this will be a find way to find out!
